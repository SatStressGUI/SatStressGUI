"""
A framework for calculating the surface stresses at a particular place and time
on a satellite resulting from one or more tidal potentials.

1 Input and Output
==================
Because C{satstress} is a "library" module, it doesn't do a lot of input and
output - it's mostly about doing calculations.  It does need to read in the
specification of a L{Satellite} object though, and it can write the same kind
of specification out.  To do this, it uses name-value files, and a function
called L{nvf2dict}, which creates a Python dictionary (or "associative array").

A name-value file is just a file containing a bunch of name-value pairs, like::

  ORBIT_ECCENTRICITY = 0.0094   # e must be < 0.25

It can also contain comments to enhance human readability (anything following a
'#' on a line is ignored, as with the note in the line above).

2 Satellites
============
Obviously if we want to calculate the stresses on the surface of a satellite,
we need to define the satellite, this is what the L{Satellite} object does.

2.1 Specifying a Satellite
--------------------------
  In order to specify a satellite, we need:

    - an ID of some kind for the planet/satellite pair of interest
    - the charactaristics of the satellite's orbital environment
    - the satellite's internal structure and material properties
    - the forcings to which the satellite is subjected

  From a few basic inputs, we can calculate many derived characteristics, such
  as the satellite's orbital period or the surface gravity.

  The internal structure and material properties are specified by a series of
  concentric spherical shells (layers), each one being homogeneous throughout
  its extent.  Given the densities and thicknesses of the these layers, we can
  calculate the satellite's overall size, mass, density, etc.

  Specifying a tidal forcing may be simple or complex.  For instance, the
  L{Diurnal} forcing depends only on the orbital eccentricity (and other
  orbital parameters already supplied), and the L{NSR} forcing requires only
  the addition of the non-synchronous rotation period of the shell.  Specifying
  an arbitrary true polar wander trajectory would be much more complex.

  For the moment, becuase we are only including simple forcings, their
  specifying parameters are read in from the satellite definition file.  If
  more, and more complex forcings are eventually added to the model, their
  specification will probably be split into a separate input file.

2.2 Internal Structure and Love Numbers
---------------------------------------
  C{satstress} treats the solid portions of the satellite as U{viscoelastic
  Maxwell solids <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_material>}, that respond
  differently to forcings having different frequencies (S{omega}).  Given the a
  specification of the internal structure and material properties of a
  satellite as a series of layers, and information about the tidal forcings the
  body is subject to, it's possible to calculate appropriate Love numbers,
  which describe how the body responds to a change in the gravitational
  potential.

  Currently the calculation of Love numbers is done by an external program
  written in Fortran by John Wahr and others, with roots reaching deep into the
  Dark Ages of computing.  As that code (or another Love number code) is more
  closely integrated with the model, the internal structure of the satellite
  will become more flexible, but for the moment, we are limited to assuming
  a 4-layer structure:

    - B{C{ICE_UPPER}}: The upper portion of the shell (cooler, stiffer)
    - B{C{ICE_LOWER}}: The lower portion of the shell (warmer, softer)
    - B{C{OCEAN}}: An inviscid fluid decoupling the shell from the core.
    - B{C{CORE}}: The silicate interior of the body.

3 Stresses
==========

C{satstress} can calculate the following stress fields:

  1. B{L{Diurnal}}: stresses arising from an eccentric orbit, having a
     forcing frequency equal to the orbital frequency.

  2. B{L{NSR}}: stresses arising due to the faster-than-synchronous rotation
     of a floating shell that is decoupled from the satellite's interior by a
     fluid layer (an ocean).

The expressions defining these stress fields are derived in "Modeling Stresses
on Satellites due to Non-Synchronous Rotation and Orbital Eccentricity Using
Gravitational Potential Theory" (U{preprint, 15MB PDF
<http://satstress.googlecode.com/files/Wahretal2008.pdf>}) by Wahr et al.
(submitted to I{Icarus}, in March, 2008).

3.1 Stress Fields Live in L{StressDef} Objects
----------------------------------------------
  Each of the above stress fields is defined by a similarly named L{StressDef}
  object.  These objects contain the formulae necessary to calculate the
  surface stress.  The expressions for the stresses depend on many parameters
  which are defined within the L{Satellite} object, and so to create a
  L{StressDef} object, you need to provide a L{Satellite} object.

  There are many formulae which are identical for both the L{NSR} and
  L{Diurnal} stress fields, and so instead of duplicating them in both classes,
  they reside in the L{StressDef} I{base class}, from which all L{StressDef}
  objects inherit many properties.

  The main requirement for each L{StressDef} object is that it must define the
  three components of the stress tensor S{tau}:

    - C{Ttt} (S{tau}_S{theta}S{theta}) the north-south (latitudinal) component

    - C{Tpt} (S{tau}_S{phi}S{theta} = S{tau}_S{theta}S{phi}) the shear
      component

    - C{Tpp} (S{tau}_S{phi}S{phi}) the east-west (longitudinal) component

3.2 Stress Calculations are Performed by L{StressCalc} Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------
  Once you've I{instantiated} a L{StressDef} object, or several of them (one
  for each stress you want to include), you can compose them together into a
  L{StressCalc} object, which will actually do calculations at given points on
  the surface, and given times, and return a 2x2 matrix containing the
  resulting stress tensor (each component of which is the sum of all of the
  corresponding components of the stress fields that were used to instantiated
  the L{StressCalc} object).

  This is (hopefully) easier than it sounds.  With the following few lines, you
  can construct a satellite, do a single calculation on its surface, and see
  what it looks like:

  >>> from satstress.satstress import *
  >>> the_sat = Satellite(open("input/Europa.satellite"))
  >>> the_stresses = StressCalc([Diurnal(the_sat), NSR(the_sat)])
  >>> Tau = the_stresses.tensor(theta=pi/4.0, phi=pi/3.0, t=10000)
  >>> print(Tau)

  The C{test} program included in the satstress distribution shows a slightly
  more complex example, which should be enough to get you started using the
  package.

3.3 Extending the Model  
-----------------------
  Other stress fields can (and hopefully will!), be added easily, so long as
  they use the same mathematical definition of the membrane stress tensor
  (S{tau}), as a function of co-latitude (S{theta}) (measured south from the
  north pole), east-positive longitude (S{phi}), measured from the meridian
  on the satellite which passes through the point on the satellite directly
  beneath the parent planet (assuming a synchronously rotating satellite),
  and time (B{M{t}}), defined as seconds elapsed since pericenter.

  This module could also potentially be extended to also calculate the
  surface strain (S{epsilon}) and displacement (B{M{s}}) fields, or to
  calculate the stresses at any point within the satellite.

        Construct an object representing a layer within a L{Satellite}.

        Gets values from the L{Satellite.satParams} dictionary for the
        layer that corresponds to the value of C{layer_n}.

        Each layer is defined by seven parameter values, and each layer has a
        unique numeric identifier, appended to the end of all the names of its
        parameters.  Layer zero is the core, with the number increasing as the
        satellite is built up toward the surface.  In the below list the "N" at
        the end of the parameter names should be replaced with the number of
        the layer (C{layer_n}).  Currently, because of the constraints of the
        Love number code that we are using, you must specify 4 layers (C{CORE},
        C{OCEAN}, C{ICE_LOWER}, C{ICE_UPPER}).

          - B{C{LAYER_ID_N}}: A string identifying the layer, e.g. C{OCEAN} or
            C{ICE_LOWER}

          - B{C{DENSITY_N}}: The density of the layer at zero pressure [m
            kg^-3]

            modulus) [Pa]

          - B{C{LAME_LAMBDA_N}}: The real-valued Lame parameter S{lambda} [Pa]

          - B{C{THICKNESS_N}}: The thickness of the layer [m]

          - B{C{VISCOSITY_N}}: The viscosity of the layer [Pa s]

        Not all layers necessarily require all parameters in order for the
        calculation to succeed, but it is required that they be provided.
        Parameters that will currently be ignored:

          - B{C{VISCOSITY}} of the ocean and the core.

          - B{C{LAME_MU}} of the ocean, assumed to be zero.
